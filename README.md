# LaTeX presentation template

This repository offers LaTeX templates, which the Chair of Macroeconomics: Innovation and Policy at ETH Zurich uses to present research and to hold lectures. These templates are close to the standard and just has small adjustments for needs of our chair.

### How to

1. Write your content into the `main.tex` file. Slide content in the `frame` environments and note into the `notes` commands.
2. Save changes in the `main.tex` file.
3. For the slides, you compile the `main.slides.tex`. To get a handout optimized to print on DIN A4 paper with or without additional notes, compile the `main.handout.tex`.
